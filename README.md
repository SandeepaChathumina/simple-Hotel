🧾 SANA Restaurant Menu Ordering System

Welcome to the SANA Restaurant Menu Ordering System, a beginner-friendly Python project that allows users to order items from a predefined menu and calculates the total bill based on their selection.

🛠️ Project Overview
This is a console-based Python program that simulates a basic restaurant ordering system. Users can:

View a menu with item prices.

Place an order by entering the name of an item.

Optionally add a second item to the order.

Get a total price at the end.

It's a great starting point for understanding:

Dictionaries in Python

Conditional statements (if, else)

User input handling

Basic string formatting and output

🧾 Menu

Pizza   : Rs.40
Pasta   : Rs.50
Burger  : Rs.60
Salad   : Rs.70
Coffee  : Rs.80

💡 How It Works
The user is greeted and shown the menu.

The user is asked to input the first item they wish to order.

If the item is available, it is added to the total.

The user is then asked whether they want to add another item.

If yes, a second item can be ordered and added to the total.

Finally, the program displays the total amount to be paid.


▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

Run the script using:

python hotel.py

Follow the prompts in the terminal.

🚀 Future Improvements
Allow ordering more than 2 items using a loop.

Add item quantities and calculate total accordingly.

Implement a user-friendly GUI (e.g., using Tkinter).

Save order history to a file.
